1) The output of the program:

number = 35

2) D3 in Hexadecimal

3) 00400038

4) Not including the first occurence, lw (load word) is called 6 times

5) [0x10010010]          0x00000013 0x00000000 0x626d754e 0x3d207265

SEGMENT: 0x800001C0
Address: 0x3344003c

3c: <, 00: NUL, 44: D, 33: 3

Result: <NULD3

7)

SEGMENT: 0x800001C0
Address: 0x3344003c

		3c: 0011 1100, 00: 0000 0000, 44: 0100 0100, 33: 0100 0100

So, the binary representation is: 0011 0011 0100 0100 0000 0000 0011 1100
Finding the 2’s complement, we use the compliment:
1100 1100 1011 1011 1111 1111 1100 0011
+                                     1


= 1100 1100 1011 1011 1111 1111 1100 0100
So, the 2’s complement representation is 1100 1100 1011 1011 1111 1111 1100 0100

.data 
.word stores 21, 88, -5, -10 as 32 bit quantities in successive memory
	Stores 21 in 0x10010000
	Stores 88 in 0x10010004
	Stores -5 in 0xffffffffb
	Stores -10 in 0xfffffff6
.byte Stores 10 and ‘c’ in successive bytes of memory.
	Stores 10 in 0x10010010
	Stores c in 0x10010011
.align Aligns the next datum on a 2^2 or 4 or word byte boundary.
	Starts at the next point in memory or at 0x10010014.
.space Allocates 9 bytes of space n the current segment.
	Null characters (or 0) fills 0x10010014 with 0x00000000
	Null Characters (or 0) fills 0x10010018 with 0x00000000
	Null Character starts at 1001001c with 0,  so it starts with 2 0’s in little endian.
.asciiz Stores “ABCD” in memory and null-terminates it
	Stores A at 0x1001001d
	Stores B at 0x1001001e
	Stores C at 0x1001001f
	Stores D at 0x10010020
	Stores NULL at 0x10010021
.ascii Stores “EF” in memory, but does NOT terminate it.
	Stores E in 10010022
	Stores F in 10010023
	
.text

In the terminal,
   1) Type spim and enter
   2) Type load “filename” and enter
   3) Type run and enter
   4) Type print $s0
   5) You should see: Reg 16 = 0x00000000 (0)

Since the lab1.s program only converts for one given integer input, the way to read in several integers to convert would be with the Loop Control structure. The loop should be before the conversion process in the program and should terminate once all the integers are processed. This would be known by storing the number of integers inputted into another register, and decremented until a termination condition is met.
