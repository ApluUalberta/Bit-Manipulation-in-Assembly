Finding the bug:

	Line 26, lw loads the whole word into the $a1 register, this is wrong as the comparison is not with the LSB. This pseudo-command needs to be lb instead.
	Line 37, addi $a0 $a0 increments by the corresponding amount of bytes. Since char types are 1 byte of size, it increments by 4 characters. This is wrong. It should be 1 byte.
